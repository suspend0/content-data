/**
 * This is a system for content storage which uses java objects as the content definition.
 * Objects are defined in a restricted forms so they can be easily mapped to key-value
 * pairs for storage.
 * <p/>
 * The storage system will segment an object by the types it implements and store properties
 * defined on the same type together.  For example, if you have types Name{name,desc},
 * Tagged{list tags}, and Document{various} extends Named, Tagged, the system will store
 * three JSON objects.  Queries will load from only the required fractions.
 * <p/>
 * To be stored in system, types must conform to a subset of the java type system
 * <u>
 * <li>They must be interfaces.  Implementations are provided by the system.</li>
 * <li>They must have only zero-arg methods; none mutate</li>
 * <li>Restricted return types: primitives & wrappers, String,
 * Lists and Sets of objects that conform to these same restrictions.</li>
 * <li>No reference to any other stored type since everything is de-normalized and
 * stored by value.</li>
 * <li>oh, and no methods may start with 'get'.  Author's preference.</li>
 * </u>
 * This is a storage model expressed in Java code; it's not your domain model.
 * <p></p>
 * Key concepts and their definitions:
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>Whole Type:</b> These are the objects you're storing.  They most likely
 * "mean something" to users of your application and are intended to be quite coarse
 * grained.</li>
 * <li>Fraction Type: These are portions of a whole type which are stored separately.</li>
 * <li>View Type: This is a type which serves as a query result.  These types are
 * not stored in the system.  Of course, you can query for whole or fraction types.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Additional restrictions
 * <ol>
 * <li>Every type must implement {@link Identified}.</li>
 * <li>No whole type may extend another whole type</li>
 * </ol>
